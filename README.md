If you are tired of privacy and security issues and want to improve them, this list of alternative apps may help you. This list is organized in a way that allows for a quick and easy start without requiring any special knowledge. Most of the mentioned applications are open source. Using privacy and security-focused applications protects your personal data, ensures anonymity, reduces the risk of hacks and leaks, provides control over your information, and fosters confidence in a safe online experience.

### What's the difference between Privacy, Security, Anonymity?

- Privacy is the control over access to your personal information, including awareness of the data being collected and the right to decide who can see and use it.

- Security is the protection of your personal information from unauthorized access and theft, ensuring reliable storage and safeguarding data from threats.

- Anonymity is the ability to act online without allowing others to trace your actions back to you, making you unrecognizable.
